# Q1 Import the apache log and print out the contents
# your code here
with open ("apache_log") as f:

# once you have answer for Q1 comment out the print statement to keep things tidy

# Q2 Use regex to find any instance of the word notice?
# your code here

# Q6 Use regex to count any instance of the letter p?
# your code here

# Q10 Use regex to find any ip addresses?
# your code here

# Q11 Create a script that will ask for user input, ask the user to enter a letter, then use regex to return any matches of that letter in the file?
# your code here

# Q12 adapt your answer from Q11, to use a function to search the file, the function should take one parameter - the letter you are searching for?
# your code here
